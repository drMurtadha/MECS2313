## ðŸ“˜ Course Synopsis: *MCSS2313 â€“ Advanced Computer System and Architecture*

This course explores advanced architectural concepts and performance analysis techniques that shape the design of modern high-performance computing systems. Emphasis is placed on quantitative evaluation using real-world workloads and metrics. The course follows a structured exploration based on the textbook Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy & Patterson (6th Edition), covering the following core domains:
	â€¢	Quantitative design methodology and performance evaluation
	â€¢	Memory hierarchy, cache optimization, and energy efficiency
	â€¢	Instruction-level parallelism (ILP), pipelining, and branch prediction
	â€¢	Data-level and thread-level parallelism using SIMD, GPU, and multicore systems
	â€¢	Warehouse-scale computing and cloud-scale architecture (e.g., Google, AWS)
	â€¢	Domain-specific architectures including TPU, DNN accelerators, and mobile vision processors
	â€¢	RISC-V instruction set foundations (Appendix A)

The course will blend lectures, project-based tasks, and simulation-based explorations of current architectural challenges in scalable and energy-efficient computing.combination of lectures, active learning, and project-based assignments, students will gain both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience in modern architecture paradigms.
