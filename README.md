## ðŸ“˜ Course Synopsis: *MCSS2313 â€“ Advanced Computer System and Architecture*

This course explores advanced topics in modern computer system design and architecture. It delves into architectural techniques that significantly impact system performance and efficiency, including:

- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) design  
- Instruction-level parallelism and pipelining  
- Memory hierarchy and high-speed memory systems  
- Storage technologies  
- Interconnection networks  
- Multiprocessor and multicore architectures  

Students will also examine recent developments in:

- Data-level and thread-level parallelism  
- Domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs, GPUs)  
- Warehouse-scale computing  

By integrating theoretical foundations with practical applications, the course encourages students to critically analyze architectural trade-offs and performance considerations in real-world systems.

A prior background in undergraduate-level computer architecture (or equivalent) is required. Through a combination of lectures, active learning, and project-based assignments, students will gain both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience in modern architecture paradigms.
