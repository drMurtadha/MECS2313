# MECS2313
## 📘 Course Synopsis: *MCSS2313 – Advanced Computer System and Architecture*

This course explores advanced architectural concepts and performance analysis techniques that shape the design of modern high-performance computing systems. Emphasis is placed on quantitative evaluation using real-world workloads and metrics. The course follows a structured exploration based on the textbook Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy & Patterson (6th Edition), covering the following core domains:
*	Quantitative design methodology and performance evaluation
*	Memory hierarchy, cache optimization, and energy efficiency
*	Instruction-level parallelism (ILP), pipelining, and branch prediction
*	Data-level and thread-level parallelism using SIMD, GPU, and multicore systems
*	Warehouse-scale computing and cloud-scale architecture (e.g., Google, AWS)
*	Domain-specific architectures including TPU, DNN accelerators, and mobile vision processors
*	RISC-V instruction set foundations 

The course will blend lectures, project-based tasks, and simulation-based explorations of current architectural challenges in scalable and energy-efficient computing.combination of lectures, active learning, and project-based assignments, students will gain both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience in modern architecture paradigms.
