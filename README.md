# MECS2313
ðŸ“˜ Course Synopsis: MCSS2313 â€“ Advanced Computer System and Architecture

This course explores advanced topics in modern computer system design and architecture. It delves into architectural techniques that significantly impact system performance and efficiency, including:
	â€¢	Instruction set architecture (ISA) design
	â€¢	Instruction-level parallelism and pipelining
	â€¢	Memory hierarchy and high-speed memory systems
	â€¢	Storage technologies
	â€¢	Interconnection networks
	â€¢	Multiprocessor and multicore architectures

Students will also examine recent developments in data-level and thread-level parallelism, domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs, GPUs), and warehouse-scale computing. By integrating theoretical foundations with practical applications, the course encourages students to critically analyze architectural trade-offs and performance considerations in real-world systems.

A prior background in undergraduate-level computer architecture (or equivalent) is required. Through a combination of lectures, active learning, and project-based assignments, students will gain both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience in modern architecture paradigms.
