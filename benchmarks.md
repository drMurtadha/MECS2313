# Chapter 1: Fundamental of Quantitative Design and Analysis (Continued)

## Benchmarks

To evaluate and compare computer systems objectively, we use **benchmarks** — standardized programs designed to measure performance.

### 1. Desktop Benchmarks

Benchmarks for personal computing tasks such as:

- **SPEC CPU Suite** – Most widely used CPU benchmark:
  - **SPECint**: Integer operations (e.g., compilers, office apps).
  - **SPECfp**: Floating-point operations (e.g., scientific computing).
- **Graphics/Gaming Benchmarks** – e.g., **3DMark**, in-game FPS tests.
- **Application-Based Benchmarks** – Measure task-specific performance:
  - Video encoding (e.g., HandBrake)
  - Image editing (e.g., Photoshop)
  - Web browsing (e.g., Speedometer)

### 2. Server Benchmarks

Designed to assess multi-user, high-load, and reliability scenarios:

- **SPEC CPU (Server Variant)** – Raw computational power
- **SPECweb, TPC-W** – Web/e-commerce throughput benchmarks
- **TPC-C** – Simulates complex OLTP systems (e.g., order-entry)
- **SPECjbb** – Java-based server-side performance
- **SPECpower_ssj** – Measures energy efficiency (performance per watt)

### 3. Putting It All Together: Performance, Price, and Power

When selecting a system, consider multiple dimensions:

#### Defining Performance:

- **Response Time (Execution Time)** – Time to complete a single task
- **Throughput** – Tasks completed per unit time

> `Performance = 1 / Execution Time`

#### Comparing Performance:

- If Computer A is *n* times faster than B:  
  `n = Execution_Time_B / Execution_Time_A`

- Use **geometric mean** to average across multiple benchmarks for fair comparison.

#### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):

Performance must be balanced with cost:

- **Hardware cost**
- **Software licenses**
- **Maintenance and support**
- **Power and cooling**
- **Facility costs (e.g., rack space, air conditioning)**

#### Design Decision Considerations:

Ask:

- Does it meet our **performance target**?
- What is the **TCO** over its lifetime?
- Is it within our **energy budget**?
- Is it **reliable and available** enough?

> There is no absolute “best” system — only the best fit for your goals, constraints, and environment.

## 🔍 Summary

This section on **benchmarks** equips system designers with the tools for **quantitative comparison**. By understanding how performance, price, and power interact, architects can make sound decisions — whether building a fast desktop or an efficient data center.
